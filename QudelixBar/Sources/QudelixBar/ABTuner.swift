/// Blind A/B EQ preference tuning.
///
/// Why preference rather than a hearing test: a threshold test through an
/// uncalibrated headphone measures the listener's ears, the headphone's own
/// response and the volume setting all mixed together — and the dominant term is
/// the normal shape of human hearing, which must not be equalised away. Asking
/// "which of these two do you prefer, on your own music" measures the thing we
/// actually want to set, and needs no calibration at all.
///
/// Method, and the reasons that matter more than the search itself:
///
/// - Four broad tilts rather than ten independent bands. Preference tracks a few
///   macro shapes; a ten-dimensional search would never converge in a sitting.
/// - Binary search per tilt: present two curves either side of the current
///   centre, move toward the winner, halve the step. Four rounds takes ±6 dB
///   down to ±0.75 dB.
/// - Every candidate is loudness-matched, and pre-gain is fixed for the whole
///   session. Without that the listener simply prefers whichever is louder and
///   the result is meaningless.
/// - Which side carries the higher setting is randomised per trial, so the
///   listener cannot learn the pattern.
/// - Some trials present the same curve twice. Preferences expressed on those
///   measure noise, and the result says so rather than pretending otherwise.
///
/// The tilts are applied on top of whatever curve is already loaded, so this
/// refines the user's own setup instead of replacing it. The original is restored
/// if the session is cancelled or the result discarded.
